Currently the site shows no hierarchy in the page layout and there is repetitive information throughout the pages, which isn’t necessary. The redesign will focus more on the current pets that are provided with prices displayed and also at home care after purchasing your pet. Additionally I will merge some of the pages together in the redesign to provide better navigation to the users. I will also improve the About Us page to provide clients with the company bio and location information.</p>										<p>The current largest competitor in Orlando is Airport Pets.
